<br>Project Objectives
Educational Impact: Develop a pedagogical curriculum that allows students to apply engineering and science skills to address real-world air quality issues.
Community-Centric Data Collection: Aggregate data from a distributed network of air quality sensors to understand and enhance the environmental impact of pollution on communities, particularly vulnerable areas like East Los Angeles.
About AQ-drone
Air quality varies significantly due to geographic factors, pollution sources, and weather conditions. Communities near freeways, industrial sites, and densely populated areas often face critical air quality challenges. Poor air quality can lead to severe health risks and increased mortality rates (Dockery et al., 1993). Establishing a cost-effective, sustainable, and community-driven air quality program is not only beneficial but essential.

As community air quality investigators, we aim to educate residents, municipalities, elected officials, and businesses about the air quality in their surroundings.

Innovative Solutions
Drones for Air Quality Monitoring
The AQ-drone project harnesses drone technology for continuous air quality monitoring and pollution prediction. Key features include:

AI-Guided Navigation: Drones equipped with AI and sensors autonomously detect high-pollution areas, enabling targeted air quality assessments.
TiO2 Air Purification: Drones utilize TiO2-coated plates for photocatalytic air purification. When exposed to UV light, these plates break down harmful pollutants into less harmful substances, contributing to cleaner air.
Real-time Data Collection: Drones collect crucial air quality metrics, including carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, and particulate matter, providing comprehensive insights into urban air quality.
Community Engagement and Education
Pedagogical Value: By involving students in hands-on STEM projects, we enhance learning and retention while fostering interest in STEM careers.
Data-Driven Decision Making: Our project provides valuable data to local governments and organizations, aiding in policy-making and community health initiatives.
Equipment
We use the DJI Matrice 600 Pro Hexacopter, a powerful drone capable of carrying the necessary sensors for effective air quality measurement. Details on sensors and additional hardware can be found in the hardware section.

Software
All software components, including data analysis tools and flight planning resources, are documented in the software guide.
