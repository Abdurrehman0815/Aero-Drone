About AQ-drone
Air quality varies significantly due to geographic factors, pollution sources, and weather conditions. Communities near freeways, industrial sites, and densely populated areas often face critical air quality challenges. Poor air quality can lead to severe health risks and increased mortality rates. Establishing a cost-effective, sustainable, and community-driven air quality program is not only beneficial but essential.

Innovative Solutions
Drones for Air Quality Monitoring:
The AQ-drone project harnesses drone technology for continuous air quality monitoring and pollution prediction. Key features include:

AI-Guided Navigation: Drones equipped with AI and sensors autonomously detect high-pollution areas, enabling targeted air quality assessments.

TiO2 Air Purification: Drones utilize TiO2-coated plates for photocatalytic air purification. When exposed to UV light, these plates break down harmful pollutants into less harmful substances, contributing to cleaner air.

Real-time Data Collection: Drones collect crucial air quality metrics, including carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, and particulate matter, providing comprehensive insights into urban air quality.

Software:
All software components, including data analysis tools and flight planning resources, are documented in the software guide.
